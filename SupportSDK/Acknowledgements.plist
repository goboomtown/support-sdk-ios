			<string>This library is in the public domain.
However, not all organizations are allowed to use such a license.
For example, Germany doesn't recognize the Public Domain and one is not allowed to use libraries under such license (or similar).

Thus, the library is now dual licensed,
and one is allowed to choose which license they would like to use.
